# Digital-Systems-Testing-Testable-Design
The objective of this project is to take an existing sequential circuit design, namely the ISCAS89 benchmark circuit s9234, and make it “testable” using various DFT techniques that may include scan, BIST, test/control points, and JTAG (i.e., boundary scan).
